## Tuzhub Component Library

This is the work in progress UI component library that powers tuzhub.io.

Tuzhub aspires to have a unique user experience, as such where possible all components should be developed using the `styled-components` library.


### State of project
`/lib` marks the directory containing all re-usable components. This currently is not the source of truth.

The goal is to open source these styled components as an alternative component library for use in third party or future projects.
